I've been away for nine days. I came back to a car that wouldn't start because someone left the dome light on. The nicest stranger had a battery booster pack, and got me started like nobody's business. Once we started down the corkscrew parking garage exit, the power steering cut out and the radio turned off. We made it home to our slice of rurality in an hour and twelve minutes and one wrong turn later. Safe an sound.  All that anyone could hope for.

Random imagery, staring into the depths of the St. Lawrence seaway with its cold blue invitation. 

My dad, catching a chubby bass, he, not a fisherman, seemed pleased with his catch. 

My sons needling each other.
