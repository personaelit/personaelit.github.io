        <h2>Hi, my name is Jim.</h2>
        <p>
            This is my online home. Welcome!
        </p>

        <h3>What I Do</h3>
        <p>
            I'm the Director of Ecommerce for <a href="https://www.stayonline.com">StayOnline</a>, a hybrid distribution, manufacturing, and eCommerce company specializing in power cords for business applications. 
            I work at the intersection of technology, marketing, design, and customer experience, always looking for ways to improve efficiency and add value.
        </p>

        <h3>Strengths</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Creative problem-solving</li>
            <li>Attention to detail</li>
            <li>Strong leadership and communication</li>
            <li>Web development and eCommerce strategy</li>
            <li>Persistent and motivated to improve</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Sometimes too detail-oriented</li>
            <li>Overcommitment - I can take on more than is reasonable</li>
            <li>Balancing work and personal time is a challenge</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>
            When I'm not working the gears of Ecommerce, I spend time playing guitar, fishing with my two boys, and exploring creative projects. 
            I also enjoy coding and working on side projects that blend technology and business.
        </p>

        <h3>Philosophy</h3>
        <p>
            I believe in the balance between *being* and *doing*. Productivity is important, but so is presence. 
            I strive to improve the systems around me while staying grounded in what truly mattersâ€”family, creativity, and contributing to something bigger than myself.
        </p>
        <p>
            My personal framework for a meaningful life:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Take care of yourself.</li>
            <li>Take care of your loved ones.</li>
            <li>Take care of your community.</li>
            <li>Take care of the world.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Whether it's in business, relationships, or personal growth, I believe in doing better every day and leaving things better than I found them.
        </p>

        <h3>The Painted Farmer</h3>
