        <h1>Hi, my name is Jim Smits.</h1>
        <p>
            This is my online home. Welcome!
        </p>

        <h2>What I Do</h2>
        <p>
            I'm the Director of Ecommerce for <a href="https://www.stayonline.com">StayOnline</a>, a hybrid distribution, manufacturing, and eCommerce company specializing in power cords for business applications. 
            I work at the intersection of technology, marketing, design, and customer experience, always looking for ways to improve efficiency and add value.
        </p>

        <h2>Strengths</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Creative problem-solving</li>
            <li>Strong organizational skills</li>
            <li>Clear communication</li>
            <li>Web development and eCommerce strategy</li>
            <li>Growth Mindset</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Weaknesses</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Sometimes too detail-oriented</li>
            <li>Overcommitment - I can take on more than is reasonable</li>
            <li>Balancing work and personal time is a challenge</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
            When I'm not working the gears of Ecommerce, I spend time playing guitarüé∏, fishingüé£ with my two boys, and exploring creative projects. 
            I also enjoy coding side projects and learning new technologies.
        </p>

        <h2>Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
            I believe in the balance between <strong>being</strong> and <strong>doing</strong>. Productivity is important, but so is presence. 
            I strive to improve the systems around me while staying grounded in what truly matters‚Äîfamily, creativity, and contributing to something bigger than myself.
        </p>
        <p>
            My personal framework for a meaningful life:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Take care of yourself.</li>
            <li>Take care of your loved ones.</li>
            <li>Take care of your community.</li>
            <li>Take care of the world.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I have a growth mindset and I believe in doing better every day and leaving things better than I found them.
        </p>

        <h2>The Painted Farmer</h2>

            My wife, Sarahüë©‚Äçüåæüé®, runs <strong><a href="http://thepaintedfarmer.co">The Painted Farmer</a></strong>, an agritourism business that blends farming, education, and art.
