       <p>Relentless <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55wZ7YWV5VE">ocean</a>. Pounding rocks into sand.  Seemingly interminable, rising crashing falling retreating, tumbling into tumble of rocks. An oath. This will be made by the typing of human fingers on human hands with human bones. Here is how it started, with an aside, a quick exercise to get the flow going:</p>
<aside>
Show your teeth.  Brush your teeth. Al dente (to the tooth). Saber tooth, claw tooth, fine tooth, tooth and nail. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/With_Teeth">With Teeth</a>. Get your teeth into something.  Something creative. Something fun. Something that exercises your mind. Read a book, paint a picture, draw, strum that guitar, get your hands dirty, move your limbs, stand, stretch, walk, move, <i>run</i>. 
</aside>
<p>Taking that first breath - one of many first breaths. That first breath when your lungs fill with air and you discover you are still alive, even though that wave knocked you on your ass. The first breath you take before you walk into that stressful situation.  Times stands still for a beat when you grasp the cold knob in the chilly black night. Still dripping. You've come here to say &quot;the thing&quot;. Or see <em>the</em> person. Or whatever it may be that has you riled up. Until the salty taste of courage on your lips subsides into the sweetness of tension relief. Release. A hard thing done.</p>
<p>You are free to move on.</p>
