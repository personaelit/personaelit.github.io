       <p>I think it was Netflix's mantra, &quot;If it moves, measure it&quot;.</p>
<p>And another company I worked with lived by &quot;If you do it once, document it. If you do it twice, automate it.&quot;</p>
<p>I like both of those.</p>
<p>I'd like to propose another saying to take to heart - &quot;Live in your logs.&quot;</p>
<p>So often logs are things that we look to only when there is trouble.</p>
<p>As a concrete example, you may find users engaging with a feature that you thought was not being used, or the opposite.  Maybe you've put a lot of time into something and nobody is using it.</p>
<aside>
Log everything or only log what's important to you in the here and now?
</aside>
<p>Log what you care about and look at it.  Every day. Insight comes from seeing the patterns over time.</p>
