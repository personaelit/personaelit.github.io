I think it was Netflix's mantra, "If it moves, measure it". 

And another company I worked with lived by "If you do it once, document it. If you do it twice, automate it."

I like both of those.

I'd like to propose another saying to take to heart - "Live in your logs." 

So often logs are things that we look to only when there is trouble.

As a concrete example, you may find users engaging with a feature that you thought was not being used, or the opposite.  Maybe you've put a lot of time into something and nobody is using it.

Log everything or only log what's important to you in the here and now?

Log what you care about and look at it.  Every day. Insight comes from seeing the patterns over time.
