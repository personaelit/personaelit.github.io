# Using Obsidian for Weekly Planning

- Mondays are for weekly planning.
- Coupled with Daily Journaling, this can be a powerful technique for managing time.
- The Weekly planning note becomes the agenda for the week with links to notes for individual tasks
- I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), because I like its features.
	- I can tag notes #likeso
	- I can link notes to each other
	- There is a fantastic graph view.
	- Lots of nice features, configurability, really an outstanding product
- My structure looks like this:
	- Daily Journal Folder
		- When I open "today's note" I get a file with this format: YYYY-MM-DD, dddd.md
			- Example 2025-02-07, Friday.md
	- Weekly Planning Folder
		- YYYY-MM-DD - Weekly Planning.md
- Run an <a href="../Creating-A-Weekly-Planning-Script">initialize script</a>
- Start with your calendar. 
	- Add your appointments and meetings to the appropriate days.
- Then re-evaluate current WIP
	- I have two folders in my Obsidian vault.  [^1]
		- WIP
		- Backlog
- Narrow down the WIP to only a few items.  Anything with a lower priority goes into the backlog.
- Block out time for each day of the week to dedicate to your current WIP.

[^1]: I use tags in Obsidian for blocked items
