I've become a wee bit obsessed with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md.).

If you're not familiar, Obsidian is a note-taking tool packed with nifty features.

I've been using it for a while, but only lately, have really started to exercise the features. 

<aside>
	<strong> Features such as: </strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Templates</li>
		<li>Tags</li>
		<li>Hotkeys</li>
		<li>and Graph View</li>
	</ul>
</aside>


I'd like to call out graph view.  In particular, the patterns that emerge when you start to use tagging and the graph view grouping filters. Here is my current graph.

<img src="obsidian-graph-view.png" alt="my obsidian graph view" title="Obsidian Graph View"/>

Those red items? Tagged as \#blocked, The green - in my WIP (Work in Progress) folder.  The purple on the periphery?  Backlog items that need attention. The big gray dots are [planning](../Weekly-Planning), review, and meetings

It's a visual representation of my workload *with meaning.*

As I continue to work, take notes, tag, and organize, new patterns emerge.  It's like my personal pet Kombucha SCOBY[^1] . 

Later, I may write about [templating in obsidian](../Templating-In-Obsidian), [hotkeys](../Obsidian-Hotkeys), and [tags](../Obsidian-Tags), but for now, that's all. 



[^1]: Fun fact - SCOBY is an acronym like scuba.  It stands for Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria and Yeast.
