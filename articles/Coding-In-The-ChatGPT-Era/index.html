       <p>Confessions of a mediocre coder, in short, if you're not using it, you're not adapting to the post AI world.</p>
<p>For example, the cover image of this post was generated using Midjourney.</p>
<p>However, this article is written by a human, pinky swear</p>
<p>But I could just ask an AI to do it.</p>
<p>And as you're probably at least subconsciously aware, the results would be passable if not a little bland.</p>
<p>Anyway, I promised something about coding in the title.</p>
<p>So here it is:</p>
<p>AI is going to be a part of your coding life. If it isn't already.
And if you're not using it, you're not adapting to the post AI world.</p>
<p>Just now as I wrote this in VS code, Copilot suggested the last two paragraphs, and I simply hit tab to fill in the content.</p>
<p>So about that pinky swear, I guess I lied.</p>
<h2 id="adapt">Adapt</h2>
<p>Seriously though, I have major reservations about AI.  Its <a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/ai-has-environmental-problem-heres-what-world-can-do-about">environmental impact</a> is significant. As are concerns about the <a href="https://hbr.org/2023/04/generative-ai-has-an-intellectual-property-problem">IP rights that were trampled</a> to train the models. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-hallucinations">It's output is questionable.</a> However, in spite of all of it's downsides, AI is <i>useful.</i></p>
<aside>
<p>Copilot suggested this (somewhat) factually incorrect line with made up links:</p>
<p class="strike-through">For example, I used <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/midjourney">Midjourney</a> to generate the cover image for this article.  I used <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gpt-3.5">GPT-3.5</a> to generate the first paragraph.  And I used <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/copilot">Copilot</a> to generate the last two paragraphs.</p>

<h2 id="e.g">E.g.</h2>
<p>Now for some code. This is a function I wrote that cycles through colors before I started using AI. (A little embarrassing as it is verbose and procedural and I didn't know about <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> which I should have used instead of <code>setInterval</code>.)</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', (event) => {
	let orb = document.getElementById("orb");
	let orbBackground = document.getElementById("orbBackground");
	
	let red = Math.floor(Math.random() * 255);
	let green = Math.floor(Math.random() * 255);
	let blue = Math.floor(Math.random() * 255);
	
	let redAscending = true;
	let blueAscending = true;
	let greenAscending = true;
	
	setInterval(() => {
	if (redAscending && red < 255) {
		red++;
	}
	else if (red >= 0) {
		if (red == 0) {
			redAscending = true;
		}
		else {
			redAscending = false;
			red--;
		}
	}
	}, Math.round(Math.random() * (100 - 10)) + 10);
	
	setInterval(() => {
	if (blueAscending && blue < 255) {
		blue++;
	}
	else if (blue >= 0) {
		if (blue == 0) {
			blueAscending = true;
		}
		else {
			blueAscending = false;
			blue--;
		}
	}
	}, Math.round(Math.random() * (100 - 10)) + 10);
	
	setInterval(() => {
	if (greenAscending && green < 255) {
		green++;
	}
	else if (green >= 0) {
		if (green == 0) {
			greenAscending = true;
		}
		else {
			greenAscending = false;
			green--;
		}
	}
	}, Math.round(Math.random() * (100 - 10)) + 10);
	
	setInterval(() => {
	
	orb.style.boxShadow = `inset 0px 0px 80px 40px rgb(${red},${green},${blue})`
	orb.style.border = `1px solid rgb(${red},${green},${blue})`
	orbBackground.style.boxShadow = `0px 0px 80px 40px rgb(${red},${green},${blue})`
	orbBackground.style.border = `1px solid rgb(${red},${green},${blue})`
	}, 10)
});

<p>Here is ChatGPT's implementation (to be fair, I had to coax it, and used my code as a seed.)</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
	let orb = document.getElementById("orb");
	let orbBackground = document.getElementById("orbBackground");
	let hue = Math.floor(Math.random() * 360); // Start with a random hue
	let hueSpeed = 1; // Speed of hue transition
	
	function animate() {
		hue = (hue + hueSpeed) % 360; // Increment hue and wrap around at 360
		let color = `hsl(${hue}, 100%, 50%)`; // Full saturation, 50% lightness
		orb.style.boxShadow = `inset 0px 0px 80px 40px ${color}`;
		orb.style.border = `1px solid ${color}`;
		orbBackground.style.boxShadow = `0px 0px 80px 40px ${color}`;
		orbBackground.style.border = `1px solid ${color}`;
		requestAnimationFrame(animate);
	}
	animate();
});
</code>
</pre>
<p>Much more succinct, and documented with comments (your opinions about code comments notwithstanding.)</p>
<p>And here is a snippet from another project that changes the text color based on the background color. I was very proud of this when I wrote it because I had to figure the math out on my own. The point being, it doesn't look like much, but it took thought.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
if (rgb[0] + rgb[1] + rgb[2] > 255 * 3 / 2) {
	document.body.style.color = `rgb(,,)`
}
else {
	document.body.style.color = `rgb(${255},${255},${255})`
}
</code></pre>
<p>I described the same problem to ChatGPT using natural language and got this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
function adjustTextColor() {
	// Get the computed background color	
	let bgColor = window.getComputedStyle(document.body).backgroundColor;	
	
	// Extract RGB values	
	let rgb = bgColor.match(/\d+/g).map(Number);	
	
	if (rgb.length < 3) return; // Ensure valid RGB values	
	
	// Calculate luminance using the standard formula	
	let luminance = (0.299 * rgb[0] + 0.587 * rgb[1] + 0.114 * rgb[2]) / 255;	
	
	// Set text color based on luminance threshold	
	document.body.style.color = luminance > 0.5 ? "black" : "white";	
}	
// Run function on page load	
adjustTextColor();
</code></pre>
<p>It's a little more verbose, but it's also more robust.  It's also more readable, and it's documented with comments. But more importantly, it used the standard formula for luminance - something that took me a while to do on my own (and I did it a different way).</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, in conclusion, AI is going to be a part of your coding life. If it isn't already. And if you're not using it, you're not adapting to the post AI world. And I only spoke to its usefulness, not its speed, which is another upside of AI.</p>
