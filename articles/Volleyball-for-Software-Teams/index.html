       <p>What Makes for a Good Volleyball Team?</p>
<p>Well, good athletes of course—tall, athletic, quick, with good mental acuity.</p>
<p>And you have those athletes, right? Because like every organization, you only hire the best. Even if &quot;best&quot; means having wicked growth potential.</p>
<p>But regardless of the individual members of your team, there is a secret sauce to winning—the same secret sauce that good volleyball teams use...</p>
<p>Communication</p>
<p>When you watch volleyball players on the court, they are all talking to each other—calling for the ball, calling someone else off the ball, and so on.</p>
<aside><a href="https://www.liveabout.com/beverly-oden-bio-3428572">Beverly Oden</a>, a decorated Olympic Volleyball player,  <a href="https://www.liveabout.com/volleyball-team-communication-3428900">breaks it down for us</a>.</aside>
<p>Like all metaphors, this one breaks down at some point, because we are talking about pushing bits as a team, not spiking the ball in our opponents' faces.</p>
<p>But it does tie into the <a href="../What-is-Agile">Agile Manifesto</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</strong><br />
<strong>Working software over comprehensive documentation</strong><br />
<strong>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</strong><br />
<strong>Responding to change over following a plan</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Three of the four principles are about communication: valuing people over process, collaborating with customers, and responding to change.</p>
<p>All of those require clear communication.</p>
