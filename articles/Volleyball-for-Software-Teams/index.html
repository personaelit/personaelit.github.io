            <p>What makes for a good volleyball team?</p>  <p>Well good athletes of course. Tall, athletic, quick, good mental acuity. </p>  
            <p>And you have those athletes, right? Because like every organization, you only hire the best. Even if best means has wicked growth potential.</p>  
            <p>But regardless of the individual members of your team, there is a secret sauce to winning, the same secret sauce that good volleyball teams use...</p>  
            <p>Communication.</p>  
            <p>When you watch volleyball players on the court, they are all talking to each other, calling for the ball, calling someone else off the ball, and so on.</p>  
            <p>

                <a href="https://www.liveabout.com/volleyball-team-communication-3428900">breaks it down for us</a>.</p>  
                <p>Like all metaphors, this one breaks down ast some point, because we are talking about pushing bits as a team, not spiking the ball in our opponents' faces. </p>  
                <p>But it does tie into the <a href="../What-is-Agile">Agile Manifesto</a>: </p>  
                <blockquote> 
                    Individuals and interactions over processes and tools<br> 
                    Working software over comprehensive documentation<br> 
                    Customer collaboration over contract negotiation<br> 
                    Responding to change over following a plan 
                </blockquote>  
                <p>Three of the four principles are about communication. Value people over process. Collaborate with customers. Responding to change.  </p>  
                <p>All of those require clear communication.</p>
