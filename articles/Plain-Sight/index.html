       <p>Myopia is real.  I remember when we had this little Belarusian stay at our house and I was intently working on a drawing.  I was working on the eyes.  The shading was just right, I captured the light pretty well. But then I held it at arms length and the little Belarusian said &quot;troll&quot;. I had drawn Sloth from <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWr30uoSCrw">The Goonies</a></em>.  The eyes didn't line up. The proportions were all off.  But boy did he have the prettiest eyes.  I had gotten so lost in the details that I never saw the big picture.</p>
<p>Life is like that all the time. We live nose to nose with our problems. Eyes to crooked eyes.</p>
<p>Well, I was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3weZOm0EwE">standing in the shower thinking</a>, and I thought about a similar problem.  Staring straight at something but never seeing it.  I thought there must be a word for that.  Down the rabbit hole.</p>
<h2 id="semantic-satiation">Semantic Satiation</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_satiation">Semantic Satiation</a></p>
<p>The word is meaningless.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KT3vOCWA-J0">Like roads</a>.  This most recently happened to me with the word commerce (for obvious reasons if you've read my <a href="/about/">about</a>).  Not quite what I was looking for.</p>
<h2 id="gestaltzerfall">Gestaltzerfall</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestaltzerfall">Gestaltzerfall</a></p>
<p>Kind of like semantic satiation but for real physical objects. I have to admit, I am more confused after reading that wiki than I was beforehand. (Is there a word for that?) Is confusion the <a href="../Seed-of-Knowledge">seed of knowledge</a>?</p>
<h2 id="scotoma">Scotoma</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotoma">Scotoma</a> is the not so proverbial blind spot.  I literally, (literally), just had this experience while looking for a toggle in my eCommerce platform. This sounds like what I am looking for except the blind spot is front and center - not on the periphery. Maybe the real blind spot isn’t in our vision—it’s in the way we think we’re seeing clearly?</p>

You ever look straight as something for so long that you don't even see it anymore?

<p>The chessboard is a mirror. <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/67c13000-4f14-8004-834d-2827ab9e5db8">The jabberwocky does not fear the vorpal blade.</a> You can see real far but you can't see wide. Reverse myopia. <a href="404">You Can't See What's Not There</a>. In summation, up is down, left is right, <a href="https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/1984/quotes/">war is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmzuRXLzqKk">cats and dogs living together, mass hysteria</a> The closer we stare, the less we see—until the obvious vanishes into the familiar, hiding in plain sight.</p>
