Myopia is real.  I remember when we had this little Belarusian stay at our house and I was intently working on a drawing.  I was working on the eyes.  The shading was just right, I captured the light pretty well. But then I held it at arms length and the little Belarusian said "troll". I had drawn Sloth from *[The Goonies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWr30uoSCrw)*.  The eyes didn't line up. The proportions were all off.  But boy did he have the prettiest eyes.  I had gotten so lost in the details that I never saw the big picture.

Life is like that all the time. We live nose to nose with our problems. Eyes to crooked eyes.

Well, I was [standing in the shower thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3weZOm0EwE), and I thought about a similar problem.  Staring straight at something but never seeing it.  I thought there must be a word for that.  Down the rabbit hole.

## Semantic Satiation

[Semantic Satiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_satiation) 

The word is meaningless.  [Like roads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KT3vOCWA-J0).  This most recently happened to me with the word commerce (for obvious reasons if you've read my [about](/about/)).  Not quite what I was looking for.

## Gestaltzerfall

[Gestaltzerfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestaltzerfall) 

Kind of like semantic satiation but for real physical objects. I have to admit, I am more confused after reading that wiki than I was beforehand. (Is there a word for that?) Is confusion the [seed of knowledge](../Seed-of-Knowledge)?

## Scotoma

[Scotoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotoma) is the not so proverbial blind spot.  I literally, (literally), just had this experience while looking for a toggle in my eCommerce platform. This sounds like what I am looking for except the blind spot is front and center - not on the periphery. Maybe the real blind spot isn’t in our vision—it’s in the way we think we’re seeing clearly?

## Like Through A Looking Glass

The chessboard is a mirror. [The jabberwocky does not fear the vorpal blade.](https://chatgpt.com/share/67c13000-4f14-8004-834d-2827ab9e5db8) You can see real far but you can't see wide. Reverse myopia. [You Can't See What's Not There](404). In summation, up is down, left is right, [war is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength](https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/1984/quotes/) - [cats and dogs living together, mass hysteria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmzuRXLzqKk) The closer we stare, the less we see—until the obvious vanishes into the familiar, hiding in plain sight.
