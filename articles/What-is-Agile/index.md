When we talk about [The Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/), it's not merely about specific methodologies, tools, or metrics.

Contrary to popular belief, it's not strictly about kanban or scrum methodologies. It's not just about burn-down charts, velocity, or daily stand-up meetings. It isn't just about tools like Jira, Azure DevOps, or Trello. These can be part of an Agile approach, but they don't define it.

At its core, the Agile philosophy emphasizes human aspects over mechanistic ones. It values people and interactions over processes and tools, signaling that the most effective communication and decision-making processes are more likely to come from individuals interacting with each other rather than rigid procedures or state-of-the-art tools.

Agile places high importance on working software over comprehensive documentation. This doesn't mean documentation is unnecessary, but rather, it means the primary measure of progress is usable software.

Agile also encourages customer collaboration over contract negotiation. This mindset prompts frequent communication with clients to better understand their needs and swiftly respond to changes, instead of adhering strictly to predetermined contracts.

The heart of Agile also lies in responding to change over following a plan. It doesn't discard planning, but it values flexibility and the ability to quickly adapt to changes, acknowledging that the real-world challenges are often unpredictable.

Unfortunately, I would argue that much of what's called 'Agile' today misses the point entirely, especially the first one about people and interactions. Many organizations pay more attention to processes and tools rather than nurturing the necessary human aspects that make Agile truly work.

And don't just take my word for it. Andy Hunt, one of the original signatories of the Agile Manifesto, has expressed similar concerns. He was there when Agile was born and knows the intention behind it. [In his talks, he echoes the same sentiment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-BOSpxYJ9M).
