                        This website is hosted on github pages,
                    </h1> which is great *free* way to host a static website. This is a static site, which to those of you who may not know, means that is has no server side rendering, and no database backend.  Just raw HTML files, CSS and javascript files. That said, I try to automate as many things as possible. For example, building out lists of links from files or folders in a directory and shoving them into a template file.</p>
