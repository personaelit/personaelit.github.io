            Hi! <a href="about">My name is Jim</a>. This is my online home. I am a Director of Ecommerce, by way of
            Software Development Manager and full stack developer. See my <a href="about">about</a> page for more details about me.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is my <a href="portfolio/">portfolio of projects</a> from the pre-chatGPT era. They are just virtual cards scattered over my virtual portfolio page at this point.
        </p>
        <p>Someday I hope to write some <a href="articles">real articles</a>, but there are only a couple of things there presently.</p>
        <p><a href="chatGPT">Quick stuff I generated with ChatGPT.</a></p>
        <p>My current pet project is <a href="cursor/allinaday/">a gimmicky calendar app</a> that acts as a mood journal. I hope to add more features to it soon.</p>
