            Hi! <a href="about">My name is Jim</a>. This is my <a href="zen">zen garden</a>.  I am Director of Ecommerce, by way of
            Software Development Manager and full stack developer. See my <a href="about">about</a> page for more
            details about me.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is my <a href="portfolio/">portfolio of projects</a> from the pre-chatGPT era. They are just virtual
            cards scattered over my virtual portfolio page at this point.
        </p>

        <p><a href="chatGPT">ChatGPT Dump Ground.</a></p>
        <p>I am working on <a href="cursor/allinaday/">a gimmicky calendar app</a> that acts as a mood
            journal. I hope to add more features to it soon.</p>

    <aside>
        <p>Here is a smattering of other things that I have made (with AI):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="chatGPT/nirvana/">Nirvana</a> - a 0-player game which is a representation of spiritual growth.
                Your "seeker" collects mana until nirvana is achieved. Like spiritual growth, the game becomes more
                difficult as you progress.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="cursor/3d-conway/">3D Conway's Game of Life</a> - <strong>Warning: Flashing Lights</strong> a
                3D representation of Conway's Game of Life. It is a 3D grid of cubes that follow the rules of the game
                of life. Rainbow colors are used for good measure.
            </li>
            <li>
                and not least the <a href="zen.html">Zen Garden</a>.
            </li>
        </ul>
