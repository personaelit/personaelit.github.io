<p>What makes for a good volleyball team?</p>

<p>Well good athletes of course. Tall, atheltic, quick, good mental aquity. </p>

<p>And you have those athletes, right? Because like every organization, you only hire the best. Even if best means has wicked growth potential.</p>

<p>But regardless of the individual members of your team, there is a secret sauce to winning, the same secret sauce that good volleyball teams use...</p>

<p>Communication.</p>

<p>When you watch volleyball players on the court, they are all talking to each other, calling for the ball, calling someone else off the ball, and so on.</p>

<p>Like all metaphors, this one breaks down ast some point, because we are talking about pushing bits as a team, not spiking the ball in our opponents' faces. </p>

<p>But it does tie into the <a href="what-is-agile.html">Agile Manifesto</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
Individuals and interactions over processes and tools<br>
Working software over comprehensive documentation<br>
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation<br>
Responding to change over following a plan
</blockquote>

<p>In my mind, three of the four principles, are about communication. Value people over process. Collaborate with customers. Responding to change.  </p>

<p>All of those require clear communication.</p>
