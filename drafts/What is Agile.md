# What is Agile?

[The Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/).

It ain't kanban. It ain't scrum. It ain't burndown, or velocity, or standups. It ain't Jira, or Azure DevOps or Trello.

It's people and interactions over processes and tools. It's working software over documentation. It's customer collaboration over contract negotiation and it's responding to change over following a plan. 

I'd even argue that most Agile today fails the very first point...

And don't take my word for it, Andy Hunt was there when it started. [And he's saying this too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-BOSpxYJ9M).
