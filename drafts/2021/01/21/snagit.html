It's funny how little things become big things.  Proverbial snowballs to the face. Anyway, the following is the impetus of this post.
TBH, by the time I got this text loaded in a text editor, I've semi-forgotten what I am doing here to begin with.  I hope that this will get better with time.  It all started way back when...
I wanted to share an image in a Slack post - this is the first time I have used a Slack post in years* and I think they are a lovely and underused feaure of the product, at least from my limited exposure.
So anyway, I didn't know how to add one, there was no drag and drop, no apparent upload feature, etc. So I searched it**, and found out that you can link to an image you've previoiusly uploaded to slack (i didn't want to do this for reason available upon request), or you could link to one directly from the web.  Of course there were a multitude of ways I could have done this, but it was just the excuse I needed to set up the website that has been on my todo list. The little thing began to grow.
Ok, this post is growing longer than its usefulness, so I will uncork it here - the shit I ended up doing to merely share an image:

Settig up a new githup pages repo
"building"*** the site strucutre via powershell, which required a few trips to google****
Remappig may snagit library directory before giving up and remapping it back to the defualt (another google)

And finally wrote this post.*****

*I've got some thoughts about slack - mostly about how I have seen it used and a little bit about how it could be used.
** Searching in the 21st cetntury - why?
*** two folders.
**** I now know more about Set-Content, Add-Content and New-Item so this exrcise is not a waste.
***** There is come intellectual equivelant of technical debt that took place here today.
